1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
 - Is something wrong?

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,500
 - I wanted to look extraordinary for you tonight.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,500
 But it appears my barber may have been looking

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,500
 at a picture of a dog when he gave me this haircut.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,500
 - I guess it does kind of look like dog ears.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,500
 - I really wanted this to go well.

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,500
 I really did. - Oh, I know, Peter.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,500
 - I really wanted to have two girlfriends.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,500
 - You already have a girlfriend?

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,500
 - I do, yeah, but I wanted two.

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,500
 I think that would be even better.

12
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,500
 Think about it, two girlfriends, that's better.

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,500
 You know what I'm saying, Meredith?

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,500
 - Uh, you, uh, you were saying your boss was, like,

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,500
 acting crazy?
