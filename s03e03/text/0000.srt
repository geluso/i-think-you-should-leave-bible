1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
 (dramatic music)

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:09,220
 - Come with me.

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,340
 Let's use our imagination, shall we?

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,620
 - Coming to the Candlelight Theater this spring,

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,140
 Richard Brekke brings his mastery of silent theater

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,800
 to the stage as Jellybean.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,680
 - No props, an empty stage.

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,660
 Let me paint you a world.

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,340
 - Using only gesture and emotion,

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,100
 he creates 73 stories that will leave you

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,820
 on the edge of your seat.

12
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,220
 - And I never talk.

13
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,220
 - Watch and wonder as he transports you

14
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,780
 to the furthest reaches of your imagination.

15
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,300
 - And if I talk, you get money.

16
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,500
 But I never talk.

17
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,180
 - Audiences across the country have sold out theaters

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,460
 to marvel at his wordless stories

19
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,300
 and try to get him to talk.

20
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:57,780
 - What are you doing?

21
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,860
 What is that?

22
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,180
 What are you doing?

23
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,220
 - What are you doing?

24
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,420
 What are you doing?

25
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,940
 What are you doing?

26
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:09,780
 - What is that?

27
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,620
 - What are you doing?

28
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,460
 - What are you doing?

29
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,300
 What is that?

30
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,140
 - What are you doing?

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:13,980
 - What is that?

32
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:14,800
 - What is that?

33
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,640
 - It's a ring.

34
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,480
 (bell dings)

35
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,300
 - Richard Brekke.

36
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,060
 (bell dinging)
