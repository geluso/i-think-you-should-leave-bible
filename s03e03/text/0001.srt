00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
 Richard Brekke has entrenched himself in one of the country's most charming eras.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,640
 And with his unique craftsmanship, he brings to life 73 tales both as personal as they

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,640
 are universal.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,640
 The fuck is that?

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,640
 I wanna know now!

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,640
 Just hold on!

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,640
 The fuck is that?

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,640
 Just wait a minute!

9
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,640
 I wanna know right now!

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,640
 Just look at it!

11
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,640
 I wanna know now!

12
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,640
 I wanna know right now!

13
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,640
 The fucking blank, you fucking scumbag!

14
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,400
 Lose yourself in the world of the mind.

15
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,960
 And don't just come and try and make me talk.

16
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,880
 I don't want to talk.

17
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,200
 I love this stuff.

18
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,800
 I love old stuff.

19
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,520
 Only come here if you like that stuff.

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,040
 If you asked me when I started this how many frats would come, I would have said none.

21
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,440
 But now it's like all frats.

22
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,960
 All frats and bachelor parties.

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,040
 Leave me alone!
