1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
 - I'm trying to say-- - Where you think

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,080
 it comes from, the bank?

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,080
 (audience laughing)

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,160
 - Barley, I just-- - Hold on a second.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,800
 I gotta do something really fast.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,200
 What the fuck?

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,400
 Is everything all right?

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,760
 Not sure.

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,120
 - I'll size you up and I'll cut you down.

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,920
 - But if I feel like you're getting the best of me,

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,840
 I have no problem being on my phone the whole show.

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,480
 - It's impossible to keep gas prices this high.

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,520
 - That's exactly the point I made two seconds ago.

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,360
 - Fuck!

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,800
 - Barley? - Hold on a second.

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,040
 I gotta do something for my mom.

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,400
 She's not getting any hot water.

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,880
 - Well, one thing I-- - Hold on, hold on.

19
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,800
 Everything's crazy at her house.

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,960
 Hold on one second.

21
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,800
 - Is she okay?

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,240
 Barley? - She can't take a shower.
