 It's simply too good.

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,780
 The dream is to have five cars going around state walk.

40
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,540
 I thought he was trying to steal my decals.

41
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,720
 - He was walking his dog.

42
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,760
 - He was walking right up the car.

43
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,760
 He was trying to rip the hat off.

44
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,960
 He was trying to rip the cigar off.

00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,240
 There's people that wanna kill me, James.

50
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,860
 - They wanna kill you for doing the driving crooner?

51
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,780
 - Yeah.

52
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,940
 - Jesus.

53
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,440

 Hey, what do you think of Richard from work?

56
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,920
 He's got that big Cadillac.

57
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,960
 I could just slap the sticker on the side.

58
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,160
 He'd be a perfect driving crooner.

59
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,500
 That would generate revenue.

60
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,040

 Fuck, fucking hell!

00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,220
 Fuck, oh no!

65
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,060
 - What?

66
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,760
 - Frat boys, they're gonna try and run us off the road.

67
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,600
 - What?

68
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,940
 Roll up the window.

69
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,020
 - There's nothing on it.

70
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,480
 - Oh, we know what's on it.

71
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,860
 - There's no stickers on it.

72
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,200
 - Yes, there is.

73
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,820
 I'm gonna kill you.

74
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:37,240
 I'm gonna fucking kill you, driving crooner!

75
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:49,000
 - Are you all right?

76
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,720
 - I'm so sick of this.

77
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,680
 Why do they hate it so much?

78
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,680
 (sighing)

79
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,220
 When I was a kid, I fell into a river

80
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,680
 and a fish bumped me out of the water.

81
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,680
 I was supposed to die,

82
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,320
 but a fish bumped me out with its nose.

83
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,820
 That was the earth telling me

84
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,940
 I was supposed to do something great.

85
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,080
 And I know that's the driving crooner.

86
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,200
 It has to be.

87
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,660
 You know what I mean, James?

88
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,260
 I'm so sick of this!
