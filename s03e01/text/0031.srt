1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
 - Let me look at this!

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,500
 - You're just embarrassed because you thought

3
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,340
 that Puerto Rico had a--

4
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,800
 - No, my mom's getting raw.

5
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,180
 - And she's texting you about it.

6
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,180
 - The guys are.

7
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,180
 - What are they texting?

8
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,640
 - Sent me a picture of her tied up

9
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,100

10
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:16,180

 - I love how this phone works.

12
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,100
 (upbeat music)

13
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:29,740
 - Okay, so building a good team is not

14
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,240
 Building a team in business is like building any team,

15
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,540
 even the Cardinals.
