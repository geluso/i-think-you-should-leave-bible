00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
 - Jason fucking rules.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,600
 (laughing)

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,060
 - I'd have to take your word for that.

4
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:06,360
 - Honestly, this is all I wanted for my 40th birthday.

5
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,600
 Just my oldest friends,

6
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,360
 just doing all the stuff we used to do.

7
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,540
 - And your newest friends.

8
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,740
 - You see, Jason, I got all that shit from high school.

9
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,600
 Four Locos, Red Dog beers.

10
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,920
 - Yeah, I heard you guys were doing this throwback theme,

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,420
 so I brought something that me

12
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,240
 and my old high school friends used to do.

13
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,380
 It should be here any minute.

14
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,220
 - Nice.

15
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,920
 - When the thing I got coming gets here,

16
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,520
 we're not gonna wanna leave the house.

17
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,720
 - Oh my God, you get us Coke?

18
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,880
 - Let's just say we might not be going to Corset.
