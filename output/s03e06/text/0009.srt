1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 Totally.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Okay, for real, what are some ways she can handle it?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 She can go to HR.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Sure. What else could she do?

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 She could say, "No, I'm not comfortable doing that,"

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 or "I don't want to do that."

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Stating a boundary. That's good.

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 And by vocalizing them, you can give others a chance

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 to reevaluate their actions.

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Boundaries are a wonderful way to help build trust...

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 [laughing]

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 ...and mutually respectful relationships.
