1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
 You really can't do anything when someone says shut up.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,520
 I hadn't been on a date in 10 years.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,400
 TK Jeweler sold me a watch that exploded every which way.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,320
 You said it exploded when you bent your wrist?

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,960
 Yeah, I was showing my date a picture of Bunny

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,960
 and showing her what the bunny was doing.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,320
 and then 150 springs hit her in the face.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,820
 The springs went in her soup.

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,820
 There was 300 springs in her soup.

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,320
 Sounds like a really bad date.

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,320
 Sucked!

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,320
 Just try not to interrupt.

13
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,320
 You said millions of people were gonna hear our voices.

14
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,150
 And I'm just a man looking for love.

15
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,950
 A lot of these places, they try and rip off people like me,

16
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,950
 people who are looking for love.

17
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,330
 Well, I guess we could leave some of it in

18
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,330
 if it will help some people.

19
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,330
 [ Applause ]

20
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,830
 Yeah, Rhett, it's a little going on.

21
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,020
 - A little goes a long way.

22
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,000
 A little goes a long way.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,200
 All you gotta do is try.

24
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,260
 - All right, from the top, let's go.

25
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,260
 (audience cheering)

26
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:02,900
 - All right, and action.

27
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,120
 - Somewhere in the static.
