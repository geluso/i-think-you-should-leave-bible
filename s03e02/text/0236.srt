1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
 All right, guys, we're getting some commentary

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,000
 from the sound guys.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,080
 You're just supposed to laugh, not talk.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,120
 Was anybody talking?

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,160
 Was anyone here ripped off by a place called

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,680
 TK Jewelers and L&L Limos?

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,080
 And Avani Suits.

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,810
 Sir, you can't talk. You understand?

9
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:21,810
 Yep.

10
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,810
 Okay.

11
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,810
 But what about after the laughs?

12
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,310
 There's, like, a space.

13
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,810
 No, that's what we're saying.

14
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,810
 Got it. Won't happen again. Sorry.

15
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,810
 What do you mean the limo driver had an...

16
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:40,620
 area you couldn't go in? Oh yeah well he had a piece of plywood painted black

17
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,540
 like it was the wall of the limo like it was the end of the limo but I could hear

18
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,700
 people in there and there was a part of it that was over the ice tray and

19
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,140
 sometimes we'd see

20
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,530
 a hand come underneath the plywood and grab the ice tray to pull it to their side.

21
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,330
 And the hand had a Super Bowl ring on it.

22
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:05,630
 And every few minutes, the wall would push up like they were trying to get more space.

23
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,130
 And when I asked the driver what was going on, he said, "Shut up."
