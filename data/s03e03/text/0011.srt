1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
 That's kind of cheesy or corny, but it was actually really inspiring.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,340
 Oh wow, that's so interesting.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,960
 You forget that your co-workers have these full lives.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,300
 Oh, that's so true. You forget that when you just see them at work.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,300
 Exactly.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,880
 Enjoy it. You swear to God.

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,340
 I swear to fucking God I do.

8
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,800
 If this is true, you are my favorite person.

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,880
 I swear to God.

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,680
 Those guys are kind of being like really loud.

11
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,440
 Oh, they're just having fun.

12
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,180
 I like the way you look at the world.

13
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,320
 Yeah, I just try to look at it through that perspective.

14
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,240
 It's easy to do once you try to do it.

15
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,620
 A lot of folks don't care to try.

16
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,200
 Very true.

17
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,200
 Yeah.

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,780
 So tell me more about this work retreat.

19
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,580
 That sounds so awesome.

20
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,700
 Yeah, it was awesome. We were really surprised.

21
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,700
 I swear to God.

22
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,260
 I was having a beautiful time solo on the kayak.

23
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,580
 I see this Mako shark.

24
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,180
 It's so fucking close to me.

25
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:50,760
 What?

26
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,680
 It's like from me to that guy over there with the plaid shirt and that dog hair.

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,520
 Which guy?

28
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,800
 That guy right there with the plaid shirt and the hair that hangs over his sides like they're dog ears.

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,560
 The shark was that close?

30
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,640
 Dog hair? What the hell are you talking about? Dog hair?

31
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,820
 And my boss came and started to do karaoke. We didn't even know she was coming.

32
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,400
 Did you know Joey was almost eaten by a shark?

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:11,940
 What?

34
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:17,320
 I wasn't almost eaten. It's just the shark was as close to me as that guy whose hair looks like dog ears.

35
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,120
 I actually thought that was a dog at that chicken.

36
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,960
 Dog?

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,120
 It's like a Springer Spaniel.

38
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,960
 Dog ears?

39
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,460
 I grew up with Springers.

40
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,120
 Beautiful dogs.

41
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,620
 Dog?

42
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,080
 I mean, she's cute.
