1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
 - Now guys keep coming up to me saying,

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,500
 "What's the next wild thing we're gonna do?"

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,500
 Is there anything more interesting about you

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,800
 other than your kids?

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,640
 - I'll try.

6
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,840
 - Please try!

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,600
 I'm the most popular guy here now!

8
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,440
 - He's talking about taking a shower

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,680
 and then I get an ad for Dove soap.

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,480
 - No, I'm reading the news and on the side,

11
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,280
 all these ads keep popping up for Paw Patrol lunchbox.

12
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,980
 - Oh, so you must have kids too.

13
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,820
 - Well, I--

14
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,660
 - What are we doing next?

15
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,480
 What's the next thing?

16
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,320
 - What are we gonna do?

17
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,660
 I don't want it to be another dance.

18
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,480
 - I don't know.

19
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,320
 - I don't know.

20
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,520
 - Let's do something!

21
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,820
 - Just relax!

22
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,660
 - Oh.

23
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,100
 Let's talk about something else.

24
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,440
 - What should we talk about?

25
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,280
 - Yeah!

26
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,660
 - What's the craziest thing you've ever done?

27
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,500
 - Oh, wow.

28
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,380
 (laughing)

29
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,220
 - Okay, okay.

30
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,220
 So I'm strapped into this instructor's lap,

31
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,260
 who looks like Eddie Van Halen, right?

32
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,940
 And I look at him, I say, "I'm a bit nervous."

33
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,660
 And he says, "You should be!

34
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,160
 We're going way too fast!"

35
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,820
 (laughing)

36
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,280
 - Guys, leave the dog alone.

37
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,580
 We're not doing anything with the dog.
